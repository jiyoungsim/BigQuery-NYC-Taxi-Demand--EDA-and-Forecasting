# BigQuery-NYC-Taxi-Demand--EDA-and-Prediction

+ Cleaned, transformed, and loaded data using SQL and BigQuery API Client library to conduct project with BigQuery public data in Python.
+ Performed exploratory data analysis of taxi calls based on time and region in order to find trends and identify problems to solve.
+ Produced feature engineering for categorical feature, tuned parameters, and trained models such as baseline simple linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to predict taxi call demands in different times and regions.
+ Evaluated models by MAE and RMSE as well as analyzed results by visualizing interactive plots to show prediction values in comparison to true values in different times and regions.
+ Images of interactive plots have been added to the notebooks for easier display. Download and run the code to see full interactive features of the plots.
