# BigQuery NYC Taxi Demand--EDA and Prediction

+ This project was conducted by Young Sim.

+ **Objectives**: The goal of this project is finding trends, identifying problems, and making predictions on taxi demand to ultimately maximize revenue.

+ **Summary**:
  + Through explorary data analysis, I analyzed taxi demand by different times and regions and created visualizations, summarizing their main characteristics and trends. Some key visualizations and findins are as follows:
  
  + Insights from EDA: taxi demand vary by different times and regions. If we can predict taxi demand given different times and regions, we can possibly maximize revenue by placing more cars where demand is high.
  
  + Prediction:
  
  + Images of interactive plots have been added to the notebooks for easier display. Download and run the code to see full interactive features of the plots.
  + This project was run in Kaggle notebook using Kaggle's public dataset BigQuery integration, which allows each Kaggle user to scan 5TB every 30 days for free (reset every 30 days).

+ **Contributions**:
  + Cleaned, transformed, and loaded data using SQL and BigQuery API Client library to conduct project with BigQuery public data in Python.
  + Performed exploratory data analysis of taxi calls based on time and region in order to find trends and identify problems to solve.
  + Produced feature engineering for categorical feature, tuned parameters, and trained models such as baseline simple linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to predict taxi call demands in different times and regions.
  + Evaluated models by MAE and RMSE as well as analyzed results by visualizing interactive plots to show prediction values in comparison to true values in different times and regions.
